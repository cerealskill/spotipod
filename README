# Why Spoti My...

The idea starts because I currently listen to all my music in playlists directly from spotify. But the problem arises because spotify arbitrarily deletes the songs and this affects especially when I want to listen to a song that I really liked and it is no longer in my playlist :( . That is why I wrote spoti my to make a backup in my local of all my music on spotify and to be able to identify and download the ones that are not there from other sources. And if one day I get fed up with Spotify, I'll have all my music to take with me anywhere.
